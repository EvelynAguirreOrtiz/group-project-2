  ## Description
A project created and curated by San Antonio locals to help people who maybe new, or not so new to the wonderful city of San Antonio, find places to hang out and meet new friends. This project was put together in hopes that a user would come by check it out and maybe stay awhile to look at all the fun happenings going on that might not be any place else. There are a lot of sites out there that can tell you where the good food is, what is happening in the music sceen or at them movies. However,there are few that allow you to post on them like a community board. This is the site we were hoping to make. A way for like minded individuals to get together and Meet Up. That is how Meet Up SATX was born.
